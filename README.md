Things to Improve:
- More forethought to structure (specifically w.r.t. functions, not requiring them to use externally instantiated lists)
- There are probably ways to consolidate multiple functions into one
- Perhaps pandas wasn't the best move, or perhaps I need a smaller dictionary: the first pass is always slow (5-8 seconds)
- 'isUnique' function is not used
